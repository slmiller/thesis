        <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p id="p1">Prince Frederick Hall is a new building located on the University of Maryland campus. The building programming provisions space for academic rooms on the ground and first floors of the building. Part of the first floor and all of the second through seventh floors are used for dormitory rooms. A combination of single, double occupant, and suites provide housing for a little over 450 students.</p>
            <h3>zoning</h3>
                <p id="p2">This building is located on the University of Maryland's campus. As such, the height and location was determined by the university.</p>
		<p id="p2">maximum height: 160 feet or 11 stories (per IBC construction type 1A)</p>
            <h3>historical requirements</h3>
                <p id="p2">No historical requirements were necessary for this project; however, it was important that the building complement and reflect the surrounding area of campus.</p>
    </li>

        <h2>Building Enclosure</h2>
            <h3>facade</h3>
                <p id="p2">Materials used on the facade can be summarized into three main finishes: brick, stone, and metal. The red brick dominates the most surface area of the building and is is laid in a traditional running bond pattern. The first floor of the building is wrapped in a limestone-colored, special finish masonry unit. Metal is also used on the facade; it is used primarily to accent the curtain walls.</p>

	</li>
            <h3>roofing</h3>
                <p id="p2">The main roofing on the building is thermoplastic membrane roofing over top of 6 inches of roof and deck insulation, with an R-value of 30, supported by a 1 foot thick concrete deck. There is a minimal sloping that occurs around the roof to direct water into one of twelve downspouts.</p>

        <h2>Sustainability Features</h2>
            <p id="p1">"Planned LEED Gold Certification as a 'green' building which will include many sustainable and energy efficient design features." -from University of Maryland's Department of Residence Life website</p>
		<p id="p3">Features of the building inclued:</p>
		<p id="p3">- heating and cooling systems designed to perform 22% better than baseline performance</p>
		<p id="p3">- bike locker on ground floor & additional bike racks for visitors</p>
		<p id="p3">- recycling facilities located on each floor</p>
		<p id="p3">- water-efficient plumbing fixtures save more than 30% over conventional fixtures</p>
		<p id="p3">- recycled content is around 10% overall of the building cost</p>
		<p id="p3">- 10% of building materials and fixtures from within 500 miles of project site</p>
		<p id="p3">- use of low-emitting materials that off-gas fewer harmful compounds</p>
		<p id="p3">- more than 75% of all construction debris will be diverted from landfills and processed by recyclers for use in other future construction projects in the region</p>
		<p id="p3">- construction site surrounded by fencing to prevent erosion and storm water runoff into local storm drains</p>
